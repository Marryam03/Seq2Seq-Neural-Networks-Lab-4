1. **Importing Libraries and Data:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Filter the dataset to include only the 'ted' source.
   - Remove any null values and duplicates.
   - Sample a subset of the data for training.
   - Perform text cleaning:
     - Convert text to lowercase.
     - Remove quotes, special characters, and digits.
     - Strip extra spaces and add start and end tokens to the target sequences.

3. **Creating Vocabulary:**
   - Extract unique words from English and Hindi sentences.
   - Determine the maximum length of sentences.
   - Create token index dictionaries for mapping words to integers.

4. **Splitting Data:**
   - Shuffle and split the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Batch Generator:**
   - Define a generator function to create batches of data for training the model.

6. **Model Architecture:**
   - Define the encoder with an embedding layer and LSTM.
   - Define the decoder with an embedding layer, LSTM, and dense layer.
   - Compile the model with RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

7. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model using the fit_generator method, which uses the batch generator.
